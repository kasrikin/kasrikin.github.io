Hello this is my website repository!
I'm a Sound Designer/Audio Engineer based in Oakland, CA.
This website is both a professional portofolio for my sound work as well as a test on my web developement skills.
I'm always looking for ways to improve the site/my portfolio so feel free to contact me about anything!
Thank you to mitchell-brandon for all your help on implementation of the contact form as well as being my source for web dev expertise.

Knowledge is individual, wisdom is communal.
